🏅 Data Analysis on Olympics Datasets
This project delves into the rich history of the Olympic Games, analyzing data spanning from 1896 to 2016. By leveraging Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, we uncover trends and patterns in athlete performances, country-wise achievements, and the evolution of the Games over time.

📌 Project Overview
The primary goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical Olympic data to answer questions such as:

Which countries have dominated the Olympics over the years?

How has gender participation evolved?

What is the distribution of medals across different sports and events?

Are there observable trends in athlete demographics like age, height, and weight?

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes records from Olympic events, covering athletes, medals, years, countries, and events. It was sourced from Kaggle - Olympic History.

📂 Dataset Details
The dataset used originates from Kaggle's "120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results". It encompasses:

Athlete information: ID, Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight

Team and National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes

Games details: Year, Season, City

Sport and Event specifics

Medal achievements: Gold, Silver, Bronze

🛠️ Technologies Used
The analysis is conducted using:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔍 Key Insights
Some of the notable findings from the analysis include:

Country Performance: The United States has consistently topped the medal charts, with notable performances from countries like Russia and China in recent decades.
Gender Participation: There has been a significant increase in female athlete participation, especially post-1970s, indicating progress towards gender equality in sports.
Sport Dominance: Athletics and Swimming have the highest number of events, leading to more medal opportunities.
Athlete Demographics: Gold medalists in sports like Gymnastics tend to be younger, while sports like Equestrian see older champions.

📈 Visualizations
The notebook includes various visualizations to support the analysis:

Bar charts depicting medal counts by country
Line graphs showing trends in athlete participation over the years
Heatmaps illustrating medal distributions across sports and countries
Box plots analyzing age distributions among medalists
